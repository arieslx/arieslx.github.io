### 葡萄牙沉船，明朝民窑克拉克外销瓷
[The Wanli (AD. 1625) shipwreck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjqIOGp3yGY)

Intro:This video invites you to dive the Wanli (AD. 1625) shipwreck site. As can be seen -much of the ceramic cargo was broken, fragmented or pulverised from an onboard explosion which is likely to have followed a battle between the Dutch and the Portuguese. The site is 42 meter deep and most of the time offered very limited underwater visibility. More than 9,000 kilo porcelain shards were recovered from the site. The Wanli wreck is the tenth historical shipwreck discovered, excavated and researched by Sten Sjostrand, the owner of Nanhai Marine Archaeology Sdn. Bhd.

### 南洋臆造——出门须防白礁屿

二零二一年六月中旬在白礁附近海域发现两艘十四世纪到十九世纪沉船，其中包含元代青花瓷。印度洋和南中国海之间礁石密布，往来船只需要小心谨慎。

### 古董局中局
